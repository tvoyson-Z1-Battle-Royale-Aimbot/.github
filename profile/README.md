## 🧠 What Is a Z1 Aimbot?

A **Z1 Battle Royale aimbot** is a cheat that automatically aims and/or fires for you. It locks your crosshair to enemy hitboxes (head, chest, neck), tracks movement in real time, and can even **shoot without your input** using a **triggerbot**.

You choose how aggressive it gets — from smooth, human-like aim to instant snap-head deletions.
